* Single-cell RNA-seq of cells from mouse ankle tissue 28 days after infection with Chikungunya virus.
* Libraries from 2021-11-05 were enriched for molecules aligning to the CHIKV genome using a library resampling approach described [here](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky1204).
* CHIKV-enriched libraries were sequenced twice, 211222_A00405_0509_AH7V3HDSX3
  and 220203_A00405_0525_AHH5HYDSX3
