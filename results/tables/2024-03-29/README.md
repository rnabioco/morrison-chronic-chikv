* chikv_gsea.qs: R object containing GSEA results for chikv_markers.xlsx (open with qread function)
* mac_chikv_gsea.qs: R object containing GSEA results for mac_chikv_markers.xlsx (open with qread function)
* chikv_markers.xlsx: up/down regulated genes (CHIKV vs mock) identified by comparing all cells from the mock samples with all cells from CHIKV-infected samples
* celltype_chikv_markers.xlsx: up/down regulated genes (CHIKV vs mock) identified separately for each cell type 
* *_type_markers.xlsx: markers for each T/macrophage subset
* *_chikv_markers.xlsx: up/down regulated genes (CHIKV vs mock) identified by grouping all T/macrophages together
* *_type_chikv_markers.xlsx: up/down regulated genes (CHIKV vs mock) identified separately for each T/macrophage subset
* mac_chikv_markers_overlap.xlsx: overlap between gene lists from mac_type_chikv_markers.xlsx
* t_type_chikv_markers-2.xlsx: up/down regulated genes (CHIKV vs mock) identified by grouping all CD4 or CD8 T cells together
