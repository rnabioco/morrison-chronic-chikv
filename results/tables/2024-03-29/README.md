* type_markers.xlsx: markers for each T/macrophage subset
* chikv_markers.xlsx: up/down regulated genes (CHIKV vs mock) identified by grouping all T/macrophages together
* type_chikv_markers.xlsx: up/down regulated genes (CHIKV vs mock) identified separately for each T/macrophage subset
* mac_chikv_markers_overlap.xlsx: overlap between gene lists from mac_type_chikv_markers.xlsx
* t_type_chikv_markers-2.xlsx: up/down regulated genes (CHIKV vs mock) identified by grouping all CD4 or CD8 T cells together
